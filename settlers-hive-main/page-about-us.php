            <h3>Black Settlers of Alberta and Saskatchewan Historical Society</h3>
            <p>The Black Settlers of Alberta and Saskatchewan Historical Society or (BSAS) research, compile, coordinate
                and
                centralize the history of Black Settlers in Alberta and Saskatchewan over the last century. All early
                Black
                Settlers and pioneers are dead and buried nowâ€¦and buried with them their wonderful stories and rich
                histories.</p>
            <p>BSAS wishes to pay tribute to all the Black Settlers who came before us by preserving their stories, and
                ultimately sharing their struggles and successes with all Canadians, thereby firmly establishing their
                place
                in Canadian History.</p>
            <p>BSAS will archive and document material to educate, promote and officially recognize the historic role
                Black
                Settlers played in pioneering the lands that would become Alberta and Saskatchewan. For more than 100
                years,
                Blacks have lived, worked and contributed greatly to the prairie provinces now known as Alberta and
                Saskatchewan.</p>
